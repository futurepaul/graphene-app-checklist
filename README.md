# Paul's app checklist for moving to Graphene OS
I'm moving from stock Android to Graphene, and in the process I need to find alternatives for a bunch of apps that are only distributed via Google Play.

Not listed here are apps I use on my iPad, such as Clubhouse, Prime Video, and Byword.

## CORE PHONE FUNCTIONALITY (WHY I NEED ONE)
- [x] browser: duckduckgo browser (not good) -> vanadium (wow so good)
- [x] signal -> signal (apk)
- [x] passwords: bitwarden -> bitwarden (bitwarden's repo)
- [x] vpn: mullvad -> mullvad (apk)
- [x] samourai wallet -> samourai wallet (fdroid)
- [x] voice memos: audio recorder (fdroid) -> audio recorder
- [x] maps -> google maps -> OsmAnd+ (fdroid)
- [x] fastmail + gmail -> k-9 (fdroid, kind of bad but it works)
- [x] authy -> aegis (manually redid my 2fa for each account... there is some way to export authy tho)
- [ ] notes: gitjournal -> (I could build from source... aurora store version isn't working) 
- [ ] uber -> ???

## THE REASON I'M ON MY PHONE ALL THE TIME BUT WOULDN'T LITERALLY DIE WITHOUT
- [x] podcasts: pockcasts (<3) -> podverse (fdroid, meh)
- [x] sat stacking: swan -> swan (webapp)
- [x] twitter -> (pwa for now until I get nitter set up) 
- [ ] discord -> ???
- [ ] telegram -> telegram (fdroid is this a safe fork?)
- [x] audible -> audible (APKMirror + App Manager)
- [ ] youtube -> ??? (newpie isn't working?)
- [ ] hinge -> ARGH SINGLE FOREVER

## TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES (IS THIS LAST DECADE THINKING?)
- [ ] cashapp -> ???
- [ ] venmo -> ???
- [ ] bank: bofa -> ???
- [x] strike -> strike (aurora store)

## NICE TO HAVE
- [x] zulip -> zulip (apk!)
- [x] mastodon: tusky (fdroid) -> tusky
- [ ] citi bike -> NO (requires google play services, maybe gmini would fix... I'm getting a key but the map is helpful) 
- [x] github -> github (aurora store)
- [ ] gotenna mesh -> ???
- [ ] steam (2fa) -> (just need at home so could have on my ipad) 
- [ ] nyc ferry -> ???
- [ ] music: spotify -> ???

## PROBABLY GOOD TO BE RID OF ANYWAY
- [ ] nfl -> ??? 
- [ ] instagram -> lol RIP
- [ ] tiktok -> lol RIP
- [ ] google pay -> lol RIP
