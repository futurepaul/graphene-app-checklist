# Paul's app checklist for moving to Graphene OS
I'm moving from stock Android to Graphene, and in the process I need to find alternatives for a bunch of apps that are only distributed via Google Play.

Not listed here are apps I use on my iPad, such as Clubhouse, Prime Video, and Byword.

## CORE PHONE FUNCTIONALITY (WHY I NEED ONE)
- [x] browser: duckduckgo browser (not good) -> vanadium (wow so good)
- [x] signal -> signal (apk)
- [x] passwords: bitwarden -> bitwarden (bitwarden's repo)
- [x] vpn: mullvad -> mullvad (apk)
- [x] samourai wallet -> samourai wallet (fdroid)
- [x] voice memos: audio recorder (fdroid) -> audio recorder
- [x] maps -> google maps -> OsmAnd+ (fdroid)
- [x] fastmail + gmail -> k-9 (fdroid, kind of bad but it works)
- [x] authy -> authy (aegis looks nice? ended up using authy from APKMirror)
- [ ] notes: gitjournal -> (I could build from source) 
- [ ] uber -> ???

## THE REASON I'M ON MY PHONE ALL THE TIME BUT WOULDN'T LITERALLY DIE WITHOUT

## TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES (IS THIS LAST DECADE THINKING?)
- [ ] cashapp -> ???
- [ ] venmo -> ???
- [ ] bank: bofa -> ???
- [ ] strike -> ???

## NICE TO HAVE
- [x] zulip -> zulip (apk!)
- [x] mastodon: tusky (fdroid) -> tusky
- [ ] citi bike -> (getting a key but the map is helpful) 
- [ ] github -> ??? 
- [ ] gotenna mesh -> ???
- [ ] steam (2fa) -> (just need at home so could have on my ipad) 
- [ ] nyc ferry -> ???
- [ ] music: spotify -> ???

## PROBABLY GOOD TO BE RID OF ANYWAY
