# Paul's app checklist for moving to Graphene OS
I'm moving from stock Android to Graphene, and in the process I need to find alternatives for a bunch of apps that are only distributed via Google Play.

Not listed here are apps I use on my iPad, such as Clubhouse, Prime Video, and Byword.

## CORE PHONE FUNCTIONALITY (WHY I NEED ONE)
- [x] browser: duckduckgo browser (not good) -> vanadium (wow so good)
- [x] signal -> signal (apk)
- [x] passwords: bitwarden -> bitwarden (bitwarden's repo)
- [x] vpn: mullvad -> mullvad (apk)
- [x] samourai wallet -> samourai wallet (fdroid)
- [x] voice memos: audio recorder (fdroid) -> audio recorder
- [x] maps -> google maps -> OsmAnd+ (fdroid)
- [ ] fastmail + gmail -> (I know just need one email app but which ???)
- [ ] notes: gitjournal -> (I could build from source) 
- [ ] authy -> ??? (aegis looks nice but need authy export)

## THE REASON I'M ON MY PHONE ALL THE TIME BUT WOULDN'T LITERALLY DIE WITHOUT

- [ ] strike -> ???

## NICE TO HAVE
- [x] zulip -> zulip (apk!)
- [x] mastodon: tusky (fdroid) -> tusky
